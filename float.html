    <h1>Sailor Moon: My favorite Anime.</h1>

<p>Sailor Moon still remains my favorite anime to this day. It was the first anime I saw as an early teenager. I first saw the North American dub, I enjoyed it but a few years later, I discovered the original in Japanese. </p>

    <img id="right" src="usagi.jpg">

<p>I liked the Japanese voices of the characters much better because they felt truer to character than the English dub. Also that there were 100 or so episodes they did not even dub, so a lot of the series was missed back then. the best way to get these was to find fanmade subtitled episodes that were purchased on VHS videos, and it was reasonable. However, I was excited when actual subtitled versions came out years later.

The difference in the character portrayals was striking. Usagi is goofy. lovable, but also strong enough to step up to her role when it was obvious that this is who she was.

    Rei did not hate Usagi, she got upset at Usagi when she felt Usagi was not reaching her potential, especially when it came to her grades.

        Just because Rei got angry at Usagi doesn't mean Rei hated her. And just because Usagi got bad grades does not mean she was stupid. I'm really not that different from Usagi when it comes to Math, it's always been my hardest subject.

    <p>I felt like the North American dub missed a lot of the actual depth of the series itself and the characters. But then again, it is a series made for children so I suppose in the Western world we have our own interpretation of what children can understand.
    I was just glad I did eventually get to see the original series. I mean it wasn't TOO different and it was not diverted from the concept but there was a lot that was oversimplified and missed.
